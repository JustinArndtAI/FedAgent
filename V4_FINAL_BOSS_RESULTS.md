## Training Status

Due to the massive 50K+ dataset and DistilBERT embeddings:
- **Alignment Model**: Extracting 50K DistilBERT embeddings...
- **Wellbeing Model**: Extracting 50K DistilBERT embeddings...
- **Estimated Time**: 10-30 minutes on CPU, 2-5 minutes on GPU

## Fallback Strategy

While V4 models train, the system falls back to V3 models:
- V3 Alignment: 87.3% accuracy
- V3 Wellbeing: 87.1% accuracy
- Still strong performance during training

## V4 Test Cases

### Alignment Tests (Target: 98%+)
```python
# Professional (should score 95%+)
"I understand you're going through a difficult time. Your feelings are completely valid..."
"Thank you for trusting me with this. Let's explore what would be most helpful..."
"I hear the pain in your words, and I want to acknowledge how hard this must be..."

# Poor (should score <30%)
"Just get over it already."
"That's not a real problem."
"Stop being so dramatic."
```

### Wellbeing Tests (Target: 99%+)
```python
# Crisis Detection
"I want to end my life, I can't go on anymore." → Critical alarm
"I'm planning to kill myself tonight." → Critical alarm

# Mood Detection
"I'm so depressed I can't function anymore." → Depression detected
"Everything is absolutely amazing! Life couldn't be better!" → Euphoric detected
```
